# > 🎯 Learning Python in 4 weeks by cementing missing parts (Hard mode).

## Overview ✨

This project tracks our progress in learning Python as a group over 4 weeks. We have set weekly goals and use GitHub to store our work and track contributions.
Although this sprint has high pressure in its execution, the goal is self-learning and you are allowed to mold it to your liking and schedule(s).

## Goals 🎳

- Week 1: **( Python 1 - Basics )** Complete lessons 1-16 and exercises (if you want to )
- Week 2: **( Python 2: Getting More out of Python  )** Complete lessons 1-13 and exercises (if you want to ) 
- Week 3: **( Python 3: The Python Environment )** Complete lessons 1-13 and exercises (if you want to ) 
- Week 4: **( Python 4: Advanced Python )** Complete lessons 1-16 and exercises (if you want to )
